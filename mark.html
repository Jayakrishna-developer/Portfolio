                <p>I am the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook. I launched Facebook
                    from my dormitory room on February 4, 2004, with my college roommates. Over the years, Facebook has
                    grown to become one of the largest social media platforms in the world, connecting billions of people
                    globally. I am passionate about technology and innovation, continuously working towards creating tools
                    that help people stay connected and share their experiences.</p>
